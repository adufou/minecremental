# Important

## Textures
The textures are placeholders and are not final. I'm currently using the textures from [Faithful 32x32](https://faithfulpack.net) for convenience. I am planning to switch to an open source alternative as soon as possible.

To generate the textures, I used either of the mods [BlockRenderer by unascribed](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockrenderer) or [Block Renderer \[Forge/Fabric\] by AterAnimAvis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/block-renderer) to do a 2D/3D render of the blocks, with 64x64 PNG files.
